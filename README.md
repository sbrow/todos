# Todos
![Todos](https://github.com/izqui/todos/blob/master/demo.gif)

Get the TODO's in your code directly into Github Issues. Uses pre-commit Git hooks to check for new TODO's every time you commit to the repo.

[Example](#how-to-install-it)

### How to install it? 

At the moment of writing, you need to have Go installed. //TODO: Create distribution binaries [Issue: https://github.com/izqui/todos/issues/41] [Issue](https://github.com/sbrow/todos/issues/8)
```.sh 
go get github.com/izqui/todos
```
### How to use it?

Just run `todos setup` inside the repo you'd like to track your issues.

Make sure you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`

### How does it work?

Todos installs a git `precommit hook` in your local Git repository, so whenever you are about to commit todos will look for `TODO:` tags in comments an submit a Github issue. The issue url is referenced in the code, so you can jump directly there when browsing your code. [Issue](https://github.com/sbrow/todos/issues/10)

In the same way, when you delete the TODO from your code, todos will mark the issue as closed in Github and add a message in your commit description, so you know this was the commit that fixed the issue.

* `todos setup`: 
	* Checks if current directory is a git repository
	* Checks ~/.todos/conf for conf file with github token
	* Asks for github token if it doesn't exist
	* Asks for github owner/repo to know where to post issues
	* Adds `precommit hook` and makes it executable
	* Adds `commit-msg hook` and makes it executable 

* `todos work`: 
	* Checks if current directory is a git repository
	* Gets list of files to check from stdin or git diffs and gets list of changed files (git diff --show-names)
	* Inspects this files looking for `TODO:`  [Issue](https://github.com/sbrow/todos/issues/9)
	* Posts issue to github
	* Saves a local cache in `.todos/issues.json` of the issues it adds.
	* Checks the cache for missing todos and closes issue.
	* Saves a file in `.todos/closed.txt` that the `commit-msg hook` will append to the git message commit file.
